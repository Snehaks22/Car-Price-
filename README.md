# Car-Price
This project is a machine learning-based car price prediction model. It predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as car brand, model, age, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and more. The model is built using a gradient boosting regressor and can be extended with other models or used as-is for basic price prediction tasks.
